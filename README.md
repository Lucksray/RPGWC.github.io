### Current Update

The ~~current~~ version 0.1 has a basic front-end that has very minimal interactivity with the API and Database.
This version should only be used with the Postman program to submit and retreive data.
This version should not be released to the public before any proper front-end is fully developed and has fully interactivity.

The ~~current~~ version 0.2 has full Controller functionality with an overwatch controller for mass submition of data.
This version should yet again only be used with the Postman program to submit and retrieve data. There are a few problems with the submition or retrieval of data through the websites.
This version should not be released to the public before any fully developed fron-end is developed and contains full interactivity.

The current version 0.3 has 60% Test coverage with a few tests being problematic with unhelpful errors being unable to be solved.
This version is very similar to version 0.2 and such should really be used with the Postman program to submit and retrieve data.
This version should not be released to the public before any full front-end development is implemented with full interactivity.



### Road Map

###### **Version 0.1**

For the Java and API to contain basic interactivity with the database so that data can be submitted and retrieved.

###### **Version 0.2**

For the front-end to interact with the API on a basic level to submit and retrieve.

###### **Version 0.3**

For testing to prove that all Services, Controllers and DTO's are functioning as expected and view what problems that should be fixed.

###### **Version 0.4**

For the Front-end to be more presentable with better CSS and image icons to make the webpage more pleasing to look at.
